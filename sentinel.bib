   abstract = {Sentinel-2 satellites have become one of the main resources for Earth observation images because they are free of charge, have a great spatial coverage and high temporal revisit. Sentinel-2 senses the same location providing different spatial resolutions as well as generating a multi-spectral image with 13 bands of 10, 20, and 60 m/pixel. In this work, we propose a single-image super-resolution model based on convolutional neural networks that enhances the low-resolution bands (20 m and 60 m) to reach the maximal resolution sensed (10 m) at the same time, whereas other approaches provide two independent models for each group of LR bands. Our proposed model, named Sen2-RDSR, is made up of Residual in Residual blocks that produce two final outputs at maximal resolution, one for 20 m/pixel bands and the other for 60 m/pixel bands. The training is done in two stages, first focusing on 20 m bands and then on the 60 m bands. Experimental results using six quality metrics (RMSE, SRE, SAM, PSNR, SSIM, ERGAS) show that our model has superior performance compared to other state-of-the-art approaches, and it is very effective and suitable as a preliminary step for land and coastal applications, as studies involving pixel-based classification for Land-Use-Land-Cover or the generation of vegetation indices.},

   abstract = {Given the continuous increase in the global population, the food manufacturers are advocated to either intensify the use of cropland or expand the farmland, making land cover and land usage dynamics mapping vital in the area of remote sensing. In this regard, identifying and classifying a high-resolution satellite imagery scene is a prime challenge. Several approaches have been proposed either by using static rule-based thresholds (with limitation of diversity) or neural network (with data-dependent limitations). This paper adopts the inductive approach to learning from surface reflectances. A manually labeled Sentinel-2 dataset was used to build a Machine Learning (ML) model for scene classification, distinguishing six classes (Water, Shadow, Cirrus, Cloud, Snow, and Other). This models was accessed and further compared to the European Space Agency (ESA) Sen2Cor package. The proposed ML model presents a Micro-F1 value of 0.84, a considerable improvement when compared to the Sen2Cor corresponding performance of 0.59. Focusing on the problem of optical satellite image scene classification, the main research contributions of this paper are: (a) an extended manually labeled Sentinel-2 database adding surface reflectance values to an existing dataset; (b) an ensemble-based and a Neural-Network-based ML models; (c) an evaluation of model sensitivity, biasness, and diverse ability in classifying multiple classes over different geographic Sentinel-2 imagery, and finally, (d) the benchmarking of the ML approach against the Sen2Cor package.},

   abstract = {In this paper, we address the challenge of land use and land cover classification using Sentinel-2 satellite images. The Sentinel-2 satellite images are openly and freely accessible provided in the Earth observation program Copernicus. We present a novel dataset based on Sentinel-2 satellite images covering 13 spectral bands and consisting out of 10 classes with in total 27,000 labeled and geo-referenced images. We provide benchmarks for this novel dataset with its spectral bands using state-of-the-art deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNNs). With the proposed novel dataset, we achieved an overall classification accuracy of 98.57%. The resulting classification system opens a gate towards a number of Earth observation applications. We demonstrate how this classification system can be used for detecting land use and land cover changes and how it can assist in improving geographical maps. The geo-referenced dataset EuroSAT is made publicly available at https://github.com/phelber/eurosat.},

@article{Mazzia2020,
   abstract = {The increasing spatial and temporal resolution of globally available satellite images, such as provided by Sentinel-2, creates new possibilities for researchers to use freely available multi-spectral optical images, with decametric spatial resolution and more frequent revisits for remote sensing applications such as land cover and crop classification (LC&CC), agricultural monitoring and management, environment monitoring. Existing solutions dedicated to cropland mapping can be categorized based on per-pixel based and object-based. However, it is still challenging when more classes of agricultural crops are considered at a massive scale. In this paper, a novel and optimal deep learning model for pixel-based LC&CC is developed and implemented based on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) in combination with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) using multi-temporal sentinel-2 imagery of central north part of Italy, which has diverse agricultural system dominated by economic crop types. The proposed methodology is capable of automated feature extraction by learning time correlation of multiple images, which reduces manual feature engineering and modeling crop phenological stages. Fifteen classes, including major agricultural crops, were considered in this study. We also tested other widely used traditional machine learning algorithms for comparison such as support vector machine SVM, random forest (RF), Kernal SVM, and gradient boosting machine, also called XGBoost. The overall accuracy achieved by our proposed Pixel R-CNN was 96.5%, which showed considerable improvements in comparison with existing mainstream methods. This study showed that Pixel R-CNN based model offers a highly accurate way to assess and employ time-series data for multi-temporal classification tasks.},

   abstract = {The analysis of remote sensing images represents a highly important issue to be performed in many relevant fields such as climate change studies or land cover mapping. Traditional proposals usually identify the land cover classes from general related groups such as different tree species or different crop varieties. Additionally, these proposals commonly use information from a precise time span or season, not accounting for the variability of the data over the entire year, specially in regions with several seasons. In this work, we propose a multi-temporal classification system to identify and represent diverse land cover classes over any period of the entire year by using Sentinel-2 satellite image data. To this end, 526 representative samples were labelled from 5 complex and variable different land cover types over the Special Area of Conservation (SAC) Betanzos-Mandeo in the northwest of the Iberian Peninsula. The method achieves a satisfactory mean accuracy value of 84.0% for the testing set using the best configuration with a radial Support Vector Machine classifier. This system will be used in the study of the population connectivity of two threatened herptiles, but it can be easily extended to other species of interest in the future.},
